            </p>
            <p>
              Your resume is going to be the first thing that recruiters are
              going see. Think of your resume as
              <span class="italic font-semibold"

            <h3 class="subheader text-4xl font-extrabold">Some Tips</h3>
            <p>
              If you care and love the job, then put in the time to refine your
              resume for that job!
            </p>
            <p>
              Im sure you've heard of the saying you get what you put in, well
              it's no different in the job world. Recruiters are well aware when
              they see resumes that are resused and general, and the best way to
              stand out is to make sure your resume matches that specific role
              and company you are applying for.
            </p>
            <h3 class="subheader text-4xl font-extrabold">
              So, what can you do?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Look for keywords, really take a look at what the job posting is
              saying. I would first starts off by looking at the
              <span class="italic font-bold">Hard Skills</span>, which are
              coding languages, programs, creation etc,.
            </p>
            <p>
              Highlight those clearly in your skills section so recruiters can
              scan over and see you match the criteria.
            </p>
            <h4 class="text-2xl font-extrabold">
              Don't use a online template!
            </h4>
            <p>
              Often times companies use resume scanners to find matches for
              keywords found in the job description.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most of the time, escpecially if you are applying for a big
              company, odds are you are initially not encouraging a human that
              you are worthy but rather
              <span class="italic font-bold">a computer!</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Computers have a one way mindset for looking at documents, the
              simply scan over and see what matches. The issue with templates is
              that <span class="span font-bold italic">they do too much!</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Templates often time use all the coolest features that word has to
              offer to make the template look awesome by using tables, graphs,
              images etc,. Computes have a hard time interpreting what exactly
              is being shown if the content is dug within a table, and then
              <span class="font-extrabold">BOOM!</span> In 7 seconds you have
              been determined as not worthy. :(
            </p>
            <h4 class="text-2xl font-extrabold">
              So how do I format my resume then?
            </h4>
            <p>Keep these things in mind:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>1. Keep your document layout as flat as possible</li>
              <li>
                2. Avoid fancy templates and create your own resume.
                <span class="font-extrabold italic">Simple is Better!</span>
              </li>
              <li>
                3. Add in color, avoid images and fancy fonts, keep the font
                sizes small
              </li>
              <li>
                And to be quite literal, resumes are boring, and its better that
                way!
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h3 class="subheader text-4xl font-extrabold">
              What about the content?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Creating resume content is crucial to your success in the job
              world, and here are my tips.
            </p>
            <h4 class="text-2xl font-extrabold">Be Concise</h4>
            <p>
              Lets be honest, no one likes to read... and recruiters
              <span class="font-extrabold">DEFINITELY</span> don't like to read.
              So, be concise. Highlight the most exciting aspects of your role,
              and crucial things you did.
            </p>
            <p>
              Avoid using big fancy words. Include only relevant experiences
              that a recruiter would like to see. Remove any redundency, don't
              intentionally make your content longer. And lastly, watch for
              vagueness. Be straight to the point and describe what you did.
            </p>
            <h4 class="text-2xl font-extrabold">
              Use <span class="font-extrabold">Action Verbs!</span>

            <h3 class="subheader text-4xl font-extrabold">Stand out!</h3>
            <p>
              Show who you are, what you like to do. Express your energy and
              your passions! You are not a robot!
            </p>
            <p>
              On my resume I like to add a hobbies section. I think this holds a
              lot of value as I feel recruiters like to see what else I do.
              Also, this can call for really easy conversation when the time
              comes for an interview (hopefully).

            <h3 class="subheader text-4xl font-extrabold">My Experience</h3>
            <p>
              Last summer I was blessed to have the opportunity to intern with
              Apple in their Austin Campus. I had a lot of people ask me, "How'd
              it?"
            </p>
            <p>
              Being a self-taught developer with less than one year of
              experience landing an internship with Apple? But how?
            </p>
            <h4 class="text-2xl font-extrabold">I Networked!</h4>
            <p>
              I reached out to some people when I got the position at Apple, and
              key was that I did not reach out to them telling them to help me
              get a job. I reached out to the with the interest of learning how
              they got to their position. I also seeked guidance on how to learn
              coding languages like JavaScript, and what approaches they took to
              mastering their craft. Showing an interest in someones profession
              makes them excited and want to talk to you. So go out there and
              ask some people for some advice, then see where it takes you!
            </p>
            <p>
              If you really want to stand out, when you get advice from someone
              show them how you took their advice and implemented it. For
              example, if someone told you "go watch this course", you can go
              watch the course and come back to them with a certificate of
              completion and a casual review of what you thought of the course.

              It is a great way to show off your experiences all while getting

            <h4 class="text-2xl font-extrabold">So how should I use it?</h4>
            <p>
              I recommend searching people at companies you want go to, and
              using the school feature to look up alumni from your school. This
              way, it instantly gives you something to connect over and can be a
              great avenue for conversation.
            </p>
            <p>Take Advantage of the alumni search feature!</p>
            <p>
              Look up hiring manager for particular jobs, or connect with
              recruiters at companies you are seeking.

              Keep your Profile up to Date
            </h4>
            <p>
              Some things to do for your LinkedIn are add a profile picture, add
              the relevant skills, jobs, descriptions, bio, portfolio pieces,
              resume, educational background, extracirriculars etc,. View
              LinkedIn as a social media for your resume, allowing you to share
              your experiences on a professional platform with other recruiters,
              job seekers, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, for your profile picture you can add a open to work banner

              Cover letters are a great way to make you stand out to companies
              and recruiters.

            <p>But let's be honest...</p>
            <p>
              <span>THEY'RE A PAIN!</span> Having to make a customer cover
              letter tailored to your job application is time consuming. But
              let's keep this in mind, it's your
              <span class="font-extrabold">dream job</span> for a reason, right?
            </p>
            <p>
              Recruiters can spot a generic cover letter in no time, so let's
              see how we can make a great cover letter.
            </p>
            <h4 class="text-2xl font-extrabold">Open Strong</h4>
            <p>
              Lead with a strong opening setence about who you are and why you
              are deserving of this particular role. After doing this, talk
              about your experiences but keep in mind to not rehash your resume.
              Keep it to one or two sentences of background.
            </p>
            <h4 class="text-2xl font-extrabold">Time to Brag!</h4>
            <p>
              Emphasize your personal value, and what makes you a great fit for
              this role. Hiring managers want people to help them solve a
              problem, so what makes you qualified to help them solve it? What
              projects have you worked on that are relevant to the job posting?
              What skills have your experiences lead you to learn?
            </p>
            <h4 class="text-2xl font-extrabold">Keep it short</h4>
            <p>
              Cover letters are a buffed up elevator speech. Ultimately it is
              something for a recruiter to glance over and get to know a little
              more about you. Get some feedback on the cover letter from some
              friends, have a positive tone in your writing and reiterate over
              it numerous times.

              Have a goal in mind and work towards it day in and day out. Figure
              out ways to make you stand out. Be self-aware, and realize the
              things you need to learn to get to where you want to me. Seek
              guidance and mentorship from those who have achieved what you
              desire.
            </p>
            <p>
              Learn to embrace not being the smartest one in the room. Accept
              that there always will be people out there that have more
              experience, go to a better school, have a better GPA, and so on.
              However if you set your sight on a place you want to be, then you
              will get there as long as you put the work in.
            </p>
            <p>
              These tips above are to get you the opportunity, to allow you to
              get a foot in the door. We can often feel lost and not know what
              to do, however what worked for me is just doing something. Taking
              some sort of initiative to try something new. Venture into the
              unkown, and get comfortable with the feeling of being
              uncomfortable. Once you start embracing the challenge of learning
